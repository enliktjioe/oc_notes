## Laying the Groundwork for Success with Meditation

- Where and when should I meditate
  - Find the time that suits you and keep it into habit
  - Try in the same place and same time
- Am I doing it right?
  - Do I feel better after I've done it?
  - The most important to remember is just relax, don't worry about it, and keep going
  - Many people think meditation is about not having thought, but the truth is:
    - we notice them, and try to ignore them, let them pass by, but we don't move with them
  - The quality of stillness

  - There is no clear answer, do what works for you, and make it as a habit
- introducing the practices

## Making It Stick

- Keep your practice going
  - Choose the practice that works for you
  - Why and How?
  - From the book Atomic Habit (James Clear)
    - we need to create system
    - start small with consistency
    - beginning of the day, end of the day, on commute, on walk
    - make a commitment starting from 1 minute every day
    - track the record and scale it
  - Find the accountability buddy, text everyday about our result, be supportive, be competitive in friendly way
- Integrated practice
  - If you need take a break between meeting, just take a deep breath, in and out
  - If you have a team, we can start the meeting with the moment of silence
    - don't try to force people who don't want to do it
  - Give 5-minute interval, such as finished at minute 25 or 55 in a hour interval
  - Gratitude practice = every end of the day, write 3 gratitudes in your day every day
