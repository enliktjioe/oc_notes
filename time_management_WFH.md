## Considerations for Working Parents and Caregivers

- Build boundaries with loved ones
  - Create a time commitment with your loved one, when is for work and for family
  - discuss specific numbers
  - quiet time
  - create a schedule for your pets
- When to delegate personal tasks
  - Housework vs Paid Work
    - List and discuss all the responsibilities
    - Delegate and designate who is responsible for specific task
    - Include them in the process
  - Understand your standardized value per hour
    - take how much you made per year from all sources divide by 2080 (average number of hours in 40 hours work week per year)
    - example: 27600 EUR (gross salary in Playtech) / 2080 = **13.26 EUR**
    - and you can use that amount for delegating the task to someone, is it the same price?
    - Make decisions about house work
      - is it less expensive than my value per hour? to hire someone to do it
      - could I reinvest the time in my job? if I hire someone
      - do I not enjoy this?
    - If the answer to all 3 questions is NO, then you should schedule your time to do it by yourself
    - Otherwise, it might better to hire someone to do it
    - "Career freedom comes not from your income per year, but from your value per hour" - Dave Crenshaw
- Manage interruptions and emergencies
  - Get empty buffer space, so you can spend it for the more important things such as family, your loved one, your hobby, etc
  - Set a timer for yourself, how long I need until I can answer this, so you can focus finishing your thing first
- The power of having fun with loved ones
  - Work Oasis - My Oasis - Family Oasis
  - Family Oasis
    - It should be more frequently than a vacation
    - Sit down with them (your loved one), starting with one question: "What would you like us to do together each day?" (for few minutes and you're enjoying it)
  - Schedule time in both calendars
- Quiz:
  - What should you commit to your family members?
    - a schedule for when you spend focused time with them
    - By committing to a set finishing time, your family knows when they do and don't have access to you.
  - What is true about a family oasis?
    - Showing up isn't enough - you need to really engage.
