# 5 Keys to Happiness at Job

## AUTONOMY

 
In "No Rules Rules" from Netflix CEO Reed Hasting, I learned that everybody at Netflix can make any decision. Even purchasing the rights for a movie for over a million dollar, flying private, or opening an entire market... with absolute 0 approval.

"We treat people like they're f*cking adults." this is their motto.

If you feel like you can't do anything without an approval, or you can't even submit ideas, it might be a true pain point.

## RELATEDNESS

 
Did you ever end up in a company and not feeling a connection with the other employees? They're great, but just not for you...

You might be the only "AI" skill in your company, and feel unable to share and discuss what you're doing or learning. Or you might work entirely remotely and miss having lunch with colleagues.

## COMPETENCE

 
"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be" -- this is how I feel about competence.
If your job is too simple, you'll get bored quicker than it takes to snap your fingers.
If you're struggling, and too challenged, you won't like it either. Nobody wants to live in the fear of being exposed as a fraud.

You need to feel competent, and to have room to grow.

Fortunately, there are solutions for these: learning new skills.
It's not just a solution to not suck at your job, it's also a solution to give yourself an advantage in the market, to maximize your options, and grow faster.

I can not recommend enough taking a cutting-edge course on Think Autonomous and see for yourself what you're capable of doing with new skills.

## IMPACT

How many people feel like they don't matter? Like whether they come to work or not will not change anything? Like next year, nothing will have changed?

Impact is one of the top killer in job happiness; and the good parts of automation are seen here, where low impact and low creativity jobs are replaced with robots.

This is why self-driving cars are so hot.

## CREATIVITY

Is your jobs just about filling excel spreadsheets? Or is it more like designing new algorithms and systems from scratch?

The more creativity you'll have, the more you'll be able to express yourself. It's as simple as that.
