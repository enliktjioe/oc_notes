## PL/SQL Is Square, Man!

- It's 3-dimensional
- Has 4 keywords:
  - DECLARE
  - BEGIN
  - EXCEPTION
  - END
- Anonymous Blocks
  ![anonymous_block](img/book_notes_beginning_pl_sql_donald_bales/anonymous_block.jpg)
- Create a Function![function](img/book_notes_beginning_pl_sql_donald_bales/function.jpg)
- Procedures
  ![procedure](img/book_notes_beginning_pl_sql_donald_bales/procedure.jpg)
- Nested Blocks

## Now Where Did I Put That?

- Variable declaration

  ```sql
  DECLARE
  	n_id			number;
  	v_name			varchar2(100);
  	d_birth_date	date;
  	v_gender		varchar2(30);
  	
  BEGIN
  ...
  END;
  ```

  - Variable anchor, using table `AUTHOR`

    ```sql
    	n_id			AUTHOR.id%TYPE;
    	v_name			AUTHOR.name%TYPE;
    	d_birth_date	AUTHOR.birth%TYPE;
    	v_gender		AUTHOR.gender%TYPE;
    ```

  - Variable assignments

    ```sql
    DECLARE
    ...
    BEGIN
    	n_id			:= 400;
    	v_name			:= 'Enlik Tjioe';
    	d_birth_date	:= to_date("19991010", 'YYYYMMDD');
    	v_gender		:= 'M';
    END;
    ```

    

- Scope

- Parameters



## Whoa! One Statement at a Time, Please!

- Insert
- Update



## Next Please, One Row at a Time!

- Cursors
  - `CURSOR` allow you to `FETCH` multiple rows from a `SQL SELECT` statement
  - Fetch manually or automatically using a `CURSOR FOR LOOP`
- Bulk Collect
  - Used to improve the efficiency of loading an array with values from the database, and you can use `FORALL` to improve the efficiency of executing SQL statements with values from an array.
