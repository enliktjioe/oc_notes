## Supporting Colleagues Who Have Experienced Loss or Change

### How to provide meaningful support

- As you begin to engage with a person with whom the loss has touched, you may be tempted to say nothing about the loss
- What we can do is to show up, to be present when they tell the story, without any effort to solve the problem
- 4 Steps
  - First, acknowledge the loss and offer your genuine condolences
  - Second, if you're not sure what else to say, indicate that you will hold the person in your thoughts and prayers
  - Third, offer to be available to listen when the person needs to talk
  - Fourth, offer to assist with more concrete support that might involve errands or meals
- Asking how are you doing, can become complicated question to answer, so try to avoid it



### What not to say

- 8 things
  - Act like nothing happened
  - Minimize the pain
  - Turn attention to your losses
  - Assign blame
  - Rush the process
  - Reason things away
  - Offer platitudes
  - Suggest that grief will last forever
- The key is to show up and be present with him/her



## Returning to Work After Loss or Change

### Make a plan for returning to work

- The more honest you are before and after you return to work, the much smoother your transition will be

### Empathy and the universality of grief, loss, change

- Each one of us has a story to tell, every experience is unique

- Remember, to show up, be present for those who need it

- You're not alone

- It takes strength of your vulnerability:

  - to experience and express it
  - ask for help
  - receive that help
  - put grief behind you and choose into leaning more fully into what gives you life

- Be gentle and compassionate with yourself, as you would with each other

- Closing quote from Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross
